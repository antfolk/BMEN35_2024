        "*   Split the data using sklearns train_test_split with test_size = 0.3 and random_state = 43\n",
        "*   **Make three different plots for each classifier** (a \"global\" feature importance plot, one \"local\" feature plot for one instance of class 0, one \"local\" feature plot for one instance of class 1.\n",
